\section*{Problem 1}
	\subsection*{a.} The SLURM\_SUBMIT\_DIR is the directory from which the currently running sbatch script was submitted
	\subsection*{b.} The Slurm job begins execution in the directory from which the job was submitted, in this case the home directory for my account
	\subsection*{c.} SLURM\_JOB\_ID is the ID of the specific job allocation
	\subsection*{d.} It specifies a job array to run simultaneously, in this case jobs 1 through 9.
	\subsection*{e.} SLURM\_ARRAY\_TASK\_ID specifies the ID of the job array that was defined with the header \#SBATCH $-$$-$array=0-9
	\subsection*{f.} The header declares that the standard output of the slurm job should be directed to the following "-o", in this case joboutput.out, and that the standard error information of the slurm job should be directed to the file following "-e", in this case joboutput.err
